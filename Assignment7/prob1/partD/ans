The intention of given java code is to remove duplicates and check whether the duplicates
list and removed duplicates are same or not.
The method intends to remove duplicates by putting the equals Employee objects key to the objects
with same value in a hashmap named “tracker”. Similar key objects are intended to store/update
with the same value as objects in the map, which implies key with similar attributes value is
intended to stored/updated once with a key object.
However, because of the setter method to the attribute “Visited” distort the equals functionality
between the Employee with same name and address but different visited status
which changes to “true” . This means that Employee with same name and address
but different visited status will be store in two different locations of Hashmap
resulting in unintended execution.
